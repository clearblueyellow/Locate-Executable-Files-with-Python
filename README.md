# Python for Cybersecurity Professionals

In the contemporary cybersecurity landscape, Security Operations Centers (SOCs) are confronted with an ever-increasing volume and sophistication of threats. To effectively manage this deluge of data, detect malicious activities, and respond swiftly to incidents, automation has become indispensable. Python, with its straightforward syntax, extensive libraries, and versatile capabilities, has emerged as a pivotal programming language for cybersecurity professionals, particularly within SOC environments. Its accessibility allows analysts who may not be dedicated software developers to create powerful tools, while its comprehensive standard library and rich ecosystem of third-party packages provide the means to tackle complex security challenges.

## Locate Executable Files with Python

This project entails the construction of a Python script to effectively locate .exe files across a computer's filesystem. The solution leverages the standard os and os.path modules, employing os.walk for efficient recursive directory traversal and os.path.splitext for accurate file extension identification. Key considerations for robustness include platform-independent path construction using os.path.join and comprehensive error handling using both try...except blocks within the processing loop and the onerror callback for os.walk to manage permissions issues gracefully.

The definition of the search scope (the root directories) is critical. While specific paths can be provided manually, the third-party psutil library offers a cross-platform method for programmatically discovering potential starting points (drives/mount points), although careful filtering is often required for practical application. The final script presented integrates these components, providing a functional and adaptable tool for filesystem searching. The alternatives using pathlib or glob offer different syntaxes but generally less control over the traversal and error handling compared to the os.walk-based approach detailed herein.
